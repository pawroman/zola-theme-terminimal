See the live demo (of the default configuration) here:
https://pawroman.github.io/zola-theme-terminimal/

Tested with Zola v0.19.2.

Please note that earlier (and older) versions might not work because of breaking changes across Zola versions.

#### Fork disclaimer

This theme is a fork (not a port) of "Terminal" Hugo theme
by Radosław Kozieł (aka. panr):
https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal

Many thanks for that outstanding original theme, Radek!

For more information about this fork and the differences to the original theme, please see:
[Changes compared to the original theme](#changes-compared-to-the-original-theme) below.

## Versioning

This theme used to be non-versioned, e.g. you'd pull the master branch, and occasionally new features or fixes would
be released.

Starting from version v1.0.0, the project adopted [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

Please check the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/pawroman/zola-theme-terminimal/releases) to see a change log
and work out if there's any breaking changes.

## How to start

Option A: clone the theme directly into your Zola site folder:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/pawroman/zola-theme-terminimal.git themes/terminimal
```

Option B: include it as a git submodule (it's better if you plan to use CI builders):

```
$ git submodule add https://github.com/pawroman/zola-theme-terminimal.git themes/terminimal
```

Then in your `config.toml` set:

```toml
theme = "terminimal"

# Sass compilation is required
compile_sass = true
```

Also see the Zola documentation on using themes:
https://www.getzola.org/documentation/themes/installing-and-using-themes/

## Shortcodes

The theme adds two custom shortcodes related to image handling.

### `image`

Used to show images.

Required arguments:

- **`src`**

Optional arguments:

- **`alt`**
- **`position`** (center \[default\] | left | right)
- **`style`**

Example:

```
{{ image(src="/img/hello.png", alt="Hello Friend",
         position="left", style="border-radius: 8px;") }}
```
  
### `figure`

Same as `image`, but with a few extra optional arguments:

- **`caption`** (supports markdown)
- **`caption_position`** (center \[default\] | left | right)
- **`caption_style`**

Example:

```
{{ figure(src="http://rustacean.net/assets/rustacean-flat-gesture.png",
          style="width: 25%;",
          position="right",
          caption_position="left",
          caption="**Ferris**, the (unofficial) Rust mascot",
          caption_style="font-style: italic;") }}
```

## OpenGraph

To add an image to a post, set the `og_image` extra option to the desired image
in the same directory of the markdown file:

```toml
[extra]
og_image = "colocated_image.png"
```

Additionally, for the section pages and for posts to have a fallback image, add
`default_og_image` to the `[extra]` section:

```toml
[extra]
default_og_image = "static/ocean.jpg"
```

## Configuration

### Only show the post's description

On each post you can specify the following:

```toml
description = "test description"

[extra]
show_only_description = true
```

This will render `test description` under this
particular post on the homepage instead of a summary.

### Colors

Both the accent colors and background colors are
configurable.

By default, both accent and background are set
to `blue`.

To configure menu, add this in `[extra]` section
of your `config.toml`:

```toml
[extra]

# One of: blue, green, orange, pink, red.
# Defaults to blue.
# Append -light for light themes, e.g. blue-light
# Or append -auto, e.g. blue-auto
accent_color = "green"

# One of: blue, dark, green, orange, pink, red, light, auto
# Enabling dark background will also modify primary font color to be darker.
# Defaults to accent color (or, if not accent color specified, to blue).
background_color = "dark"
```

### Logo text and link

You can set the "logo" text and what it links to,
by modifying `config.toml` like so:

```toml
[extra]

# The logo text - defaults to "Terminimal theme"
logo_text = "My blog"

# The logo link - defaults to base_url.
logo_home_link = "/take/me/away!"
```

### Author and copyright

You can set the footer's copyright author name like this:

```toml
[extra]

# Author name: when specified, modifies the default
# copyright text. Apart from author, it will
# contain current year and a link to the theme.
author = "My Name"
``` 

If you don't like the default copyright text,
you can set it to completely custom HTML:

```toml
[extra]

# Copyright text in HTML format. If specified,
# entirely replaces default copyright and author.
copyright_html = "My custom&nbsp;<b>copyright</b>"
```

### Menu

The menu is optional, static (all items are always shown,
no matter what the screen size) and fully user-configurable.

To configure menu, add this in `[extra]` section
of your `config.toml`:

```toml
[extra]

# menu is enabled by adding menu_items (optional)
menu_items = [
    # each of these is optional, name and url are required
    # $BASE_URL is going to be substituted by base_url from configuration
    {name = "blog", url = "$BASE_URL"},
    
    # tags should only be enabled if you have "tags" taxonomy
    # see documentation below for more details
    {name = "tags", url = "$BASE_URL/tags"},
    {name = "archive", url = "$BASE_URL/archive"},
    {name = "about me", url = "$BASE_URL/about"},
    
    # set newtab to true to make the link open in new tab
    {name = "github", url = "url-to-your-github", newtab = true},
]
```

### Tags

The theme optionally supports tags. To enable them, create
a "tags" taxonomy in your `config.toml`:

```toml
taxonomies = [
    {name = "tags"},
]
```

Enabling tags will create a new `/tags` page, and 
cause them to show up in `archive` section. Note
that you still need to create a menu link to the tags
page manually.

### Pagination

Pagination is fully supported for post list (main site)
and intra-post (you can navigate to earlier and later posts).

To make sure pagination works properly, you must first configure
it in `content/_index.md`:

```
+++
# number of pages to paginate by
paginate_by = 2

# sorting order for pagination
sort_by = "date"
+++
```

Then, tweak the theme's pagination config in `config.toml`:

```toml
[extra]

# Whether to show links to earlier and later posts
# on each post page (defaults to true).
enable_post_view_navigation = true

# The text shown at the bottom of a post,
# before earlier/later post links.
# Defaults to "Thanks for reading! Read other posts?"
post_view_navigation_prompt = "Read more"
```

### Language code

Internationalization / translation is not supported
but you can set the HTML language code for your
site:

```toml
default_language = "en"
```

### Hack font subset

By default, the theme uses a mixed subset of the Hack font.
Normal weight font uses full character set
(for Unicode icons and special symbols), but all others
(bold, italic etc) use a limited subset.

This results in much smaller transfer sizes, but the subset
might not contain all the Unicode characters you need.

You can enable full unicode support in `config.toml`:

```toml
[extra]

# Use full Hack character set, not just a subset.
# Switch this to true if you need full unicode support.
# Defaults to false.
use_full_hack_font = true
```

Also see [Hack's docs](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack/blob/master/docs/WEBFONT_USAGE.md).

### Favicon

The theme supports adding a global favicon (applies to
all pages) to the site:

```toml
# Optional: Global favicon URL and mimetype.
#           Mimetype defaults to "image/x-icon".
#           The URL should point at a file located
#           in your site's "static" directory.
favicon = "/favicon.png"
favicon_mimetype = "image/png"
```

### Page titles

The theme allows you to configure how the page titles (the `<title>` elements) are rendered.

Use `"combined"` to render titles as `"Page title | Main title"`.

```toml
# Optional: Set how <title> elements are rendered.
# Values:
# - "main_only" -- only the main title (`config.title`) is rendered.
# - "page_only" -- only the page title (if defined) is rendered,
#                  falling back to `config.title` if not defined or empty.
# - "combined" -- combine like so: "page_title | main_title",
#                 or if page_title is not defined or empty, fall back to `main_title`
#
# Note that the main (index) page only has the main title.
page_titles = "combined"
```

All the configuration options are also described in
[`config.toml`](../master/config.toml).


### RSS

This theme supports RSS feeds.
To enable RSS you need to set those 3 configuration settings to valid values: 

```toml
generate_feed = true
author = "yourself@email.com"

# Use `rss.xml` for RSS feeds and `atom.xml` for ATOM.
feed_filename = "atom.xml"
```

Note that `author` is also required as part of the RSS spec.
You can read more on https://www.getzola.org/documentation/templates/feeds/ about the potential values, since RFC 4287 requires author to be a name and not an email.

To add an RSS icon to the main menu, you can add this entry to the `menu_items` :

```toml
menu_items = [
    # RSS
    {name = "", url = "$BASE_URL/$FEED_FILENAME"}
]
```

You can also customize the color of the RSS icon by changing the `rss_icon_color`:

```toml
[extra]

# ...
rss_icon_color = "#ee802f"
```

## Extending

Each of the templates defines named blocks, so
it should be quite easy to customize the most common things.

For example, if you want to add extra `<meta>` tags to the
base template, `index.html`, create file like this in `templates/index.html`:

```html
{% extends "terminimal/templates/index.html" %}

{% block extra_head %}
    <meta name="description" content="My awesome website"/>
    <meta name="keywords" content="Hacking,Programming,Ranting"/>
{% endblock %}
```

## Changes compared to the original theme

This theme has been forked from https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal

- Slight changes in the layout and styling.
  - Content has been centered (instead of left-aligned).
  - The header stripes have been spaced out.
  - Tweaks to pagination, especially on mobile (small screens).
  - The post title underline is dashed instead of doubly-dotted.
  - All links are underlined, as per
    [Brutalist Web Design Guidelines](https://www.brutalist-web.design/).
  - Tweaks to header font sizes.
  - Minor footer tweaks.

- Absolutely **no JavaScript**.
  - No JavaScript needed to pre-process anything.
    Zola with its Sass pre-processor is the only dependency.
  - There's no menu trigger.
  - Things load crazy fast, as it's all static content.
  - Prism.js syntax highlighting is not supported (you can use
    [Zola's](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/syntax-highlighting/)).

- All references to social media (e.g. Twitter) have been removed.

- All references to external URLs (e.g. Google CDN) have been removed.
  This theme's static assets are meant to be served from where it's hosted.

- [Hack](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack) is the default font.

- The default color theme is blue (original uses orange).

### New features

- You can pick the accent color as well as background color.
  There's a new `dark` background. See [Configuration](#configuration)
  below for details.
- Active "section" links will change color indicating the
  active section. This is all static, done at template level.

### Features retained from the original

- 5 color themes, depending on your preference:
  blue (default), green, orange, pink, red.
- The shortcodes `image` and `figure` (See [Shortcodes](#shortcodes)).
- Fully responsive.
